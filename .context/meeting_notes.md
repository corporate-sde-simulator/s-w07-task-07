# Meeting Notes - Sprint 29 Planning

**Date:**
**Attendees:** Ravi Iyer (Lead), Vikram Singh, Intern

---

## API response pagination optimizer

- **Ravi Iyer:** This is blocking our release. Vikram Singh started the work but got reassigned. @Intern, take this ticket and fix the bugs identified in code review.

- **Vikram Singh:** The core structure is correct but there are two known bugs. Check the PR comments for details. The first issue is the more critical one.

## Action Items

- [ ] @Intern - Fix bugs in `paginationOptimizer.ts` and `cursorManager.ts`
- [ ] @Vikram Singh - Code review when PR is ready
- [ ] @Ravi Iyer - Final sign-off before merge
